        This IoT device was developed in collaboration with five colleagues
        during my Master's studies as part of my coursework for an Internet of
        Things module. The goal of the project was to develop a novel IoT device
        that incorporated sensors, actuators, cloud computing and a web UI. The
        prototype we developed, PartyBot, was a device for party games and
        interactive language learning built using a system of ESP32
        microcontrollers and the

        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of the game is simple: players define a set of
          <i>banned words</i> which they input to the device via a web UI, then
          the device listens passively to the players as they converse with one
          another. If the device detects that one of the players has said a
          banned word, it sounds an alarm and points an arrow at the player who
          said the word.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The primary hardware component is the ESP32-s3-Korvo-2 V3.1, a
          comprehensive multimedia development board. This board was selected
          due to its suitability for speech recognition applications. In
          addition to the speech recognition task, the Korvo also handled the
          communications with the cloud component of the system. The
          localisation of the source of each banned word was performed by a
          separate board, the ESP32-WROOM-32E. This board was connected to four
          external microphones, each covering a separate quadrant of the game
          space. The WROOM was also connected to a stepper motor, used to
          control the arrow, which it actuated to point in the direction of the
          source when a banned word was detected.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Cloud component of the PartyBot system.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The hardware component is integrated with cloud computing and a web UI
          to create an intuitive, interactive user experience. The AWS cloud
          computing platform was selected for this purpose. Specifically, AWS
          IoTCore and AWS Lambda are used: the former for communication between
          the device and the cloud, and the latter for processing logic. The
          MQTT protocol was used for communications between the board and the
          cloud, due to its suitability for applications where low bandwidth
          usage and power consumption are of paramount importance. The user
          interface was implemented using the React JavaScript library, and
          interacted with the cloud backend through AWS API Gateway's WebSocket
          API.

        <h2>Speech Recognition on an Embedded CPU</h2>
        <p>
          The most technical aspect of this project was the implementation of a
          speech recognition system on a low-power embedded CPU, particularly
          due to the need to dynamically update the speech recognition system
          via the cloud. Fortunately, the ESP32-s3-Korvo-2 board is built on the
          ESP32-S3 chip, which is the only ESP32 chip designed for SIMD (Single
          Input Multiple Data) instructions. This renders the chip compatible
          with both

        <br>
        <p
        >For this project,
            MultiNet was used, with the list of <i>command words</i> for the
            network representing the <i>banned words</i> list. The system was
            designed so that this list could be changed dynamically via the cloud,
            and the model restarted with an updated list of command words.
